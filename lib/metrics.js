/*
*
*   This file needs to be explained a bit, as it will be included in source control.
*   
*   This file exists to provide basic analytics/metrics to the bot. This will be used in the
*   future development of a web-panel, as well as provide some admin/mod/owner commands
*   that can be used to track performance, moderation, etc.
*
*   The idea is that we can track the performance of the bot, as well as various staff actions.
*   
*   In the future, I want to include many features, not just analytics, but these will be provided
*   via the web console. These features include:
*
*   - Ban/kick/timeout/etc users from the web panel
*   - Provide a resource members can link to in order get alternate invites
*   - Leveling system w/ web interface
*   - Metrics for how well a staff member is performing
*   - "Ticketing" system allowing users to report others, or counter their ban/timeout/etc.
*   - And some others that I'm not entire sure of yet.
*
*   With that in mind, the goal here is to *entirely* avoid using Google Analytics, FB Analytics, etc.
*   I want to make this entirely on my own. This will allow me to work on and build skills with
*   databases and web development.
